# My CheckiO Solutions

------------------
### Update: April 1, 2019

Getting back into the swing of things. Reorganized the folders. Trying to decide on a style guide.

Also, learned much about Node in the past months and subsequently have deleted `~/server-template.js`. However, in the spirit of intellectual honestly, I am not going to edit the solutions that implemented it though. May update the Medium article though.

Looking forward to working with you. Please make some pull requests. I'd love advice, collaboration, constructive criticism.

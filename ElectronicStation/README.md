## The Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two binary integers is the number of bit positions that differs.

```js
117 = 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
17  = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
H   = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3
```

You are given two positive numbers (N, M) in decimal form. You should calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers in binary form.

**Input**: Two arguments as integers.

**Output**: The Hamming distance as an integer.

**Example**:

```js
hammingDistance(117, 17) == 3
hammingDistance(1, 2) == 2
hammingDistance(16, 15) == 5
```

**How it is used**: This is a basis for Hamming code and other linear error-correcting programs. The Hamming distance is used in systematics as a measure of genetic distance. On a grid (ie: a chessboard,) the Hamming distance is the minimum number of moves it would take a rook to move from one cell to the other.

**Precondition**:
0 < n < 10^6
0 < m < 10^6

## 07 - String Conversion

You are given two strings, line1 and line2. Answer, what is the smallest number of operations you need to transform line1 to line2?

Operations are:

Delete one letter from one of strings
Insert one letter into one of strings
Replace one of letters from one of strings with another letter

**Input:** two arguments, two strings.

**Output:** int, minimum number of operations.

**Example:**

```js
stepsToConvert('line1', 'line1') == 0
stepsToConvert('line1', 'line2') == 1
stepsToConvert('ine', 'line2') == 2
```

**Precondition:** 0 <= len(line) < 100
